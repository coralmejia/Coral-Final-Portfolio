# Multiverse Final Portfolio
Below are some of the projects I've worked on during the apprenticeship as a jr.software engineer.

## Overview
During my Multiverse apprenticeship at American Express I delivered value through mainly admninistrative work. Helping the team out with updates, giving employeesb access to apps, and adding members to apps. Most of my tech experience and practice was on Multiverse days. (The 3 month bootcamp and every friday). Which wasz gratley appreciatd. Without Multiverse's curriculum I wouldn't have learned as much as I have. Implementing Amex's blue box values of leadership, integrity, and hardwork is what allowed me to be succussful in the company. Along with coommunication and time management skills.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to give my thanks to Multiverse for the incredible opportunity. To Jonathan for being an incredible, patient, and understanding coach. A week before the apprenticeship started my uncle was murdered by a family member. At the same time I was going through domestic violence at home. I was devastated and managed to learn in the bootcamp all while breastfeeding my 18 month old son at the time. Jonathans support and encouragement is what got me through that dark time and allowed me to not give up. Thanks AMEX for hiring me. And of course to myself for trying my best and working hard. This has been an incredible, humbling, and rewarding experience as a software engineer.
